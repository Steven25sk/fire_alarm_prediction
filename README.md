# fire_alarm_prediction

Fire can create a destructive loss, therefore to mitigate fire in a hazardous environment I have created an app to predict fire alarms.

This project is made to mitigate fire, by using classification machine learning algorithm to predict if certain airborne particles will trigger fire alarm :

- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
